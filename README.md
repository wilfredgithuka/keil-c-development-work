# Keil C / Embeeded C Development
All my development work on the STC15f2k60s2 board using Embedded C

# What is Keil C or Embeeded C?
The use of C language to program microcontrollers is becoming too common. And most of the time its not easy to buld an application in assembly which instead you can make easily in C. So Its important that you know C language for microcontroller which is commonly known as Embedded C. As we are going to use Keil C51 Compiler, hence we also call it Keil C.

# What is the STC15f2k60s2 board?
The STC15f2k60s2 series of MCU is a single chip mirocontroller based on high performance IT architecture of 8051 produced by STC MCU limited, a Chinese company. Its a new generation of 8051 MCU which is faster, stable and low power consumption and with super strong anti-distrubance.

# The STC15f2k60s2 or generally the 8051 Miroprocessor has no OS. Take Note
Because of this, when you are writing your code in the main() function, make sure you put your code in a while loop to ensure that it continues to run, otherwise it will fall into nothing.
